There are many website platforms that you can use when building a new site–Content Management Systems (CMS) is what they’re usually called.
The idea of a CMS is to give you some easy-to-use tools so that you’re able to edit your site’s content without any knowledge of coding. For the most part – from the user’s point of view–those CMS look much like the familiar interfaces at Facebook or Google Docs. You basically create new pages or documents ,and then have them published to the web.

STEP 2: PICK A NAME FOR YOUR WEBSITE
There are nearly 2 billion websites online on the web. Meaning, staying original can be quite challenging. It’s a really good idea to construct our website’s name (and thus your domain name) around either the name of your organization (the most obvious approach) or a phrase that’s associated with the niche you’re in, but with some added words for better brand ability.
In short, a good domain name should be:
❖ brandable– uniquesounding, like nothing else that’s out there in the market
❖ easy to memorize
❖ short – those are also easier to memorize
❖ easy to type and hard to mix up – you don’t want people to be wondering how to spell your site’s name
❖ including niche-related keywords – for instance, if you do anything with , it would be cool to have “pizza” somewhere in the name of the site; it works the same in non-pizza industries as well.
